# Personal and school projects.

The Repo is separated into four directories that contain personal and academic programming and research projects from my coursework. Programming projects are separated by language except for web development projects. The Web development projects tend to use a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript so they are all under one folder called "WebDev". The nonprogramming projects are under "Misc-Projects" and include research-based work that involves testing cybersecurity tools and concepts, developing secure networks for corporations, and creating a plan to sell a product. 

The hardware used in all projects was a combination of my personal laptop and desktop and Bowie State University desktops.

Many software components were used including VirtualBox, VMware, VS Code, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016 & 2022, Python, Java, Javascript, CSS, PHP, XAMPP, Rufus, Packet Tracer, Zscaler Internet Threat Exposure Analysis, ExtraHop Reveal(x), GreyNoise, and Threat Hunting With Juypter Notebooks. 

All projects except "Hajoca" and "Effectiveness of a Zero Trust Model for the Threat Hunting and Respond" were completed solely by me. I contributed half of the research, writing, and testing for the "Hajoca" and "Effectiveness of a Zero Trust Model for the Threat Hunting and Respond projects".
