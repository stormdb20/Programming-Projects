When you walk dowwn the street you see a NOUN and when you realize 
what it really is you start VERB_ING. After that you look to the left 
and can only describe what you see as ADJECTIVE. When VERB_ING goes 
horrribly right you immediately step on a NOUN and VERB!!!
You then VERB and VERB while spectators look on laughing and describing 
you as ADJECTIVE. If only you brought your NOUN when you left home you could've 
VERB and been alright.
